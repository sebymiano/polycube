``Polycube`` is an **open source** software framework that provides **fast** and **lightweight** **network functions** such as bridges, routers, firewalls, and others.

Polycube services, called `cubes`, can be composed to build arbitrary **service chains** and provide custom network connectivity to **namespaces**, **containers**, **virtual machines**, and **physical hosts**.
