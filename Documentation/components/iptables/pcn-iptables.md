# pcn-iptables: a clone of iptables based on eBPF


Polycube includes the ``pcn-iptables`` standalone application, a stateful firewall whose syntax and semantic are compatible with the well-known ``iptables`` Linux tool.

The frontend provides the same CLI of iptables; users can set up security policies using the same syntax by simply executing ``pcn-iptables`` instead of ``iptables``.
The backend is based on `eBPF` programs, more efficient classificaiton algorithms and runtime optimizations; the backend runs as a dedicated service in Polycube.



## Supported features


Currently supported features:

- Support for ``INPUT``, ``OUTPUT``, ``FORWARD`` chains
- Support for ``ip``, ``protocol``, ``ports``, ``tcp flags``, ``interfaces``
- Support for ``connection tracking``
- Support for bpf ``TC`` and ``XDP`` mode

Detailed supported parameters

- ``-s`` source IP
- ``-d`` destination IP
- ``-p`` l4 protocol
- ``--sport`` source port
- ``--dport`` destination port
- ``--tcpflags`` tcp flags
- ``-i`` input interface
- ``-o`` output interface
- ``-m conntrack --ctstate`` conntrack module

Detailed supported targets

- ``-j ACCEPT`` accept traffic
- ``-j DROP`` drop traffic

Detailed supported commands

- ``-S`` Show rules
- ``-L`` List rules

## Install


### Prerequisites


pcn-iptables comes as a component of polycube framework.
Refer to [polycube install guide](../../../installation) for dependencies, kernel requirements and basic checkout and install guide.

### Install


To compile and install ``pcn-iptables``, you should enable the ``ENABLE_PCN_IPTABLES`` flag in the polycube CMakeFile, which is set to ``OFF`` by default;
this allows to compile the customized version of ``iptables`` used to translate commands, and install in the system pcn-iptables-init pcn-iptables and pcn-iptables-clean utils.

Note:
The ``ENABLE_SERVICE_IPTABLES`` flag, which is set to ``ON`` by default, is used to compile and install the ``libpcn-iptables.so`` service (like other polycube services: bridge, router, ..).
This flag is required to be enabled as well, but it comes by default.

```
cd polycube

# Note: ensure git submodules are updated
# git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_PCN_IPTABLES=ON
make -j`nproc` && sudo make install
```

## Run


### 1. Initialize pcn-iptables


```
# Start polycubed, in other terminal (or background)
sudo polycubed --daemon
# Initialize pcn-iptables
pcn-iptables-init
```

### 2. Use pcn-iptables


``pcn-iptables`` provides same iptables syntax. Please refer to ``iptables`` online docs for more info.
Following are just few examples of available commands.

```
# E.g.
pcn-iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.1 -j DROP # Append rule to INPUT chain
pcn-iptables -D INPUT -s 10.0.0.1 -j DROP # Delete rule from INPUT chain
pcn-iptables -I INPUT -s 10.0.0.2 -j DROP # Insert rule into INPUT chain

# Example of a complex rule
pcn-iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d 10.0.0.2 -p tcp --sport 9090 --dport 80 --tcpflags SYN,ACK ACK -j DROP

# Example of a conntrack rule
pcn-iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate=ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Show rules
pcn-iptables -S # dump rules
pcn-iptables -L INPUT # dump rules for INPUT chain

pcn-iptables -P FORWARD DROP # set default policy for FORWARD chain
```


**NOTE**: do `not` use use ``sudo pcn-iptables ...``

### 3. Stop pcn-iptables


```
# Stop and clean pcn-iptables
pcn-iptables-clean

# Execute the below command to validate if cleanup is successful.
pcn-iptables -S
``Note:  On successful cleanup, you should receive "No cube found named pcn-iptables"``
```

## Advanced Features


### XDP mode


``pcn-iptables`` can also be run in ``XDP`` mode. This mode comes with performance gain, especially when policy are configured to DROP traffic.

```
pcn-iptables-init-xdp
```

### Limitations


- pcn-iptables operates only on interfaces that support XDP native mode
- traffic is not filtered on interfaces that support only eBPF TC programs.

## pcn-iptables components


``pcn-iptables`` is composed by three main components:

  1. ``pcn-iptables`` service (``src/services/pcn-iptables``): a Polycube service, a special one since performs some extra work, but basically expose its API and CLI, according to Polycube standard.

### iptables submodule


A customized fork of iptables is included as submodule under [src/components/iptables/iptables](https://github.com/polycube-network/polycube/tree/master/src/components/iptables).
This modified version of iptables is in charge of validate commands, translate them from iptables to polycube syntax, then forward them to pcn-iptables service instead of pushing them into the kernel via netfilter.

### scripts folder


Scripts are used as a glue logic to make pcn-iptables run. Main purpose is initialize, cleanup and run pcn-iptables, pass pcn-iptables parameters through iptables (in charge of converting them), then pass converted commands to pcn-iptables service.
Scripts are installed under ``/usr/local/bin``.

## pcn-iptables components


``pcn-iptables`` is composed by three main components:

1. ``pcn-iptables`` service (``src/services/pcn-iptables``): a Polycube service that is especially tailored to work with the ``pcn-iptables`` executable; as usual, it exposes its API and CLI according to Polycube standard.

2. ``iptables*`` (``src/components/iptables/iptables``): a modified version of iptables, in charge of validate commands, translate them from iptables to polycube syntax, then forward them to pcn-iptables service instead of push them into the kernel via netfilter.

3. ``scripts`` (``src/components/iptables/scripts``): this is a folder containing some glue logic and scripts to initialize, cleanup and use ``pcn-iptables``. ``pcn-iptables`` itself is a script that forwards commands to ``iptables*`` (2), then forwards the translated command to ``pcn-iptables`` (1). Scripts are installed under ``/usr/local/bin``.
