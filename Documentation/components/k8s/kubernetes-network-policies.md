# Kubernetes Network Policies


``pcn-k8s`` leverages on the Kubernetes Network Policies to protect the pods of your cluster from both external and internal unauthorized traffic, as well as preventing them from accessing other pods without permission.

All pods will be able to communicate with anyone as long as no policy is applied to them: this is called *Non-Isolation Mode*. As soon as one is deployed and applied to them, all traffic is going to be dropped, except for what is specified inside the policy, according to the direction it is filtering: incoming (``ingress``) or outgoing (``egress``) traffic.

Only ``IP`` traffic is restricted and both ``TCP`` and ``UDP`` are supported as the transport protocol.
Kubernetes Network Policies are written in a ``yaml`` format and always include the following fields:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: policy-name
    namespace: namespace-name
```

If the ``namespace`` field is omitted, the policy will be deployed to the ``default`` namespace.

## Select the pods


In order to select the pods to be protected, the ``podSelector`` field, under ``spec`` must be filled.

```yaml  
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: policy-name
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

If a pod has a label named ``app`` and its value is equal to ``my-app``, the above will be applied to it, regardless of its other labels.

``podSelector`` only supports ``matchLabels``, as ``matchExpression`` is not supported yet.

To select all pods the following syntax can be used:

```yaml  
spec:
  podSelector: {}
```

## Restrict the traffic

Both incoming and outgoing traffic can be restricted. In order to restrict incoming packets, the ``ingress`` field must be filled:

```yaml
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    # Rule 1...
  - from:
    # Rule 2...
  - from:
    # Rule 3...
```

Outgoing traffic follows a very similar pattern:

```yaml
spec:
  egress:
  - to:
    # Rule 1...
  - to:
    # Rule 2...
  - to:
    # Rule 3...
```

**NOTE**: in case of restricting outgoing traffic, ``policyTypes`` - under ``spec`` - must be filled like so:

```yaml
policyTypes:
- Ingress # Only if also restricting incoming traffic
- Egress
```

``policyTypes`` can be ignored if the policy is ``ingress``-only.

## Allow external hosts

The field ``ipBlock`` must be filled with the IPs of the hosts to allow connections from/to, written in a ``CIDR`` notation. Exceptions can be optionally specified.

```yaml
ingress:
- from:
  - ipBlock:
      cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
      except:
      - 172.17.1.0/24
```

The ips of the pods inside of the cluster are not fixed: as a result, ``ipBlock`` must not be used to restrict access from other pods in the cluster, but only for external entities.

## Allow Pods

Access from other pods is restricted by using the ``podSelector`` - introduced earlier - and ``namespaceSelector`` fields. The latter works in the same fashion as the former, selecting namespaces by their label.

- In case of only using ``podSelector`` only the pods following the criteria specified by it and that are in the same namespace as the one specified under ``metadata`` will be able to access the pod.

- If only ``namespaceSelector`` is used, all pods contained inside the namespace with the labels specified in it will be granted access to the pod.

- For a more fine-grained selection, both can be used to specifically select pods with certain labels and that are on namespaces with specific labels.

Look at the examples in the example section to learn more about their usage.

## Ports and protocols


In order to define protocols, one must use the ``ports`` field, under the ``from``/``to`` depending on the direction filtering:

```yaml
ingress:
- from:
  # rule...     
  ports:
  - port: 5000
    protocol: TCP
```

Refer to the examples section for more details.

## Deploy and Remove


In order to deploy the policy, the typical ``apply`` command must be entered:

```
# Local policy
kubectl apply -f path-to-policy.yaml

# Remote policy
kubectl apply -f https://example.com/policy.yaml
```

To remove, one of the following commands can be issued:

```
# Delete by its path
kubectl delete -f path-to-policy.yaml

# Delete by its name
kubectl delete networkpolicy policy-name
```

## Examples


### Deny all traffic


The following policy will be applied to pods that are on namespace ``production`` and have label ``app: bookstore``. It drops all incoming traffic.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: api-allow
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bookstore
ingress: []
```

The ``[]`` selects no pods: it drops all traffic from the specified direction.

### Accept all traffic


The following policy will be applied to pods that are on namespace ``production`` and have label ``app: bookstore``. It accepts all incoming traffic.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: api-allow
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bookstore
  ingress:
  - {}
```

The ``{}`` selects everything regardless of labels: it accepts all traffic in the specified direction.


### Limit connections to pods on the same namespace


The following policy will be applied to pods that are on namespace ``production`` and have label ``app: bookstore``. It accepts connections from all pods that have labels ``app: bookstore`` and ``role: api`` and that are on the **same namespace** as the policy's one.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: api-allow
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bookstore
ingress:
- from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: api
          app: bookstore
```

### Allow connections from all pods on a namespace


The following policy will be applied to pods that are on namespace ``production`` and have label ``app: bookstore``. It accepts connections from **all** pods that are running on namespaces that include the label ``app: bookstore``. 

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: api-allow
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bookstore
ingress:
- from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: bookstore
```

### Allow connections only from specific pods on specific namespaces


The following policy will be applied to pods that are on namespace ``production`` and have label ``app: bookstore``. It accepts connections from pods that have label ``role: api``, running on namespaces that include the label ``app: bookstore``. 

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: api-allow
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bookstore
ingress:
- from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: api
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: bookstore
```

### Rules and protocols combination

Rules are OR-ed with each other and are AND-ed with the protocols:

```yaml
ingress:
- from:
  # Rule 1
  - ipBlock:
      cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
      except:
      - 172.17.1.0/24
  # Rule 2
  - podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        role: frontend
  ports:
  # Protocol 1
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
  # Protocol 2
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
```

In the example above, a packet will be forwarded only if it matches one of the following conditions:

- ``Rule 1`` **AND** ``Protocol 1``
- ``Rule 1`` **AND** ``Protocol 2``
- ``Rule 2`` **AND** ``Protocol 1``
- ``Rule 2`` **AND** ``Protocol 2``

If none of the above applies, the packet is dropped.

### Outgoing traffic


All the above policies can also apply to outgoing traffic by replacing ``ingress`` with ``egress`` and ``from`` with ``to``.
Also, ``policyTypes`` must be filled accordingly.

*NOTE*: keep in mind that as soon as the policy is deployed, all unauthorized traffic will be dropped, and this includes DNS queries as well! So, a rule allowing DNS queries on port 52 can be specified to prevent this.
